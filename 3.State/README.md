## State
only usable with class based components  (for function components use HOOKS system)

props are different than state

STATE in JS object contains data relevent to a component

updateing STATE on a component causes the component to almost instantly rerender

STATE must be initialized when a component is created

STATE can only be updated using the function 'SetState'
